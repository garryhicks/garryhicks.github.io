Moving to Victoria was the best decision of my life. 


Everything has just been better since moving here. I’m really excited about my work, and I've been enjoying it and learning a lot. Life as a web developer is going to be good! I've met great people, made some friends, and gotten to know a little bit about Victoria's history. 

I went down to the water and checked out the old mooring rings, where the ships used to tie off to when they would arrive to offload exported goods and load up with the local goods Victoria was exporting back with them. The rings are the only piece left from that period, for us to see. Under a lot of the hillside, I'm told that there are pieces of ships that were too old and were falling apart, so they got covered over and became part of the shore.

By the way, I’m using [Github Pages][github-pages] to publish this blog, that way I don’t pay for hosting. And it allows me to talk to all you nice folks. So this is the beginning of my blog, and I hope you'll stick around for the rest of my (mis)adventures as we go!
