Have a seat and I'll tell you how I survived my learn-to-code bootcamp experience. 

At Lighthouse Labs in Vancouver BC, the program can be quite intense. Class begins at 9 am, runs for nearly a couple hours, and then you're left the rest of the day to code away, and gain support from TA's who are active and employed in the field. Their approach in how they help students is somewhat flexible, ranging from little hints for more advanced students, to very hands-on for students having more trouble. They always seem to give just enough help that it forces students to reach and build on one of the most important skill sets, thinking like a developer. Knowing how and what to google, in this industry, can be just as important as knowledge and experience. 

The afternoon lends itself to 'breakout sessions' typically around 3 pm, to cover anything from material that a number of students may have trouble with, to optional additional topics. These last for up to a couple of hours as well. The students are each placed in 'Pod' groups, with a specific instructor as their Pod Leader. With their Pod Leader students are given constructive criticism on the style, structure, and efficiency of their code, and get to share in a group setting ways which they could improve on their code in the future. 

Technical Interviews are another vital part of the bootcamp program. Each week the Pod Leader will sit down with the students in his/her pod, and have a technical-style mock interview. These interviews cover various aspects of the different coding languages, such as Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and other frameworks that can accompany them. They are given feedback on how they performed, and suggestions on areas they need to improve upon, if any.

There are exams at the 2, 4 and 6-week points of the program, and they can be tough. There are invariably some students who don't make the needed 80% grade on the initial take of each exam, and need to study and challenge the retake exam. This is done to ensure a consistent standard coming out of the bootcamp program. It's not just exams either though - there are projects too. One project is a mid-term project, and happens at week 4, and the other is a final project which gets demonstrated to the public, as well as potential employers at the end of Week 9. 

This is all great, but it sounds very tough right? When compared with years and years of traditional, expensive education, the current $8K price tag is becoming a much more popular and sensible alternative.

For me, the choice was a no-brainer - attempt to save enough for a traditional, expensive college education where I would have difficulty sitting still behind a desk for any conceivable amount of time, talking about theory, conceptual ideas, and system architecture? Or do the hands-on, practical thing that I could focus on for 9 weeks, and come out ahead of the college kid with an expensive piece of paper who's not getting hired as quickly because he hasn't been actually taught how to write functional Javascript?

I joke and say that I 'survived' my bootcamp experience, but for some it really does feel that way some days. You can feel like you're drowning, and the best way to describe it is to 'get uncomfortable and stay there'. If you can keep it together for 8-9 weeks, and commit that for that time you have no social life, no real family life, not many nights of going out for dinner or that kind of stuff, you can jump start your career in tech. Good options for cutting the tension are hitting tech meetups, grabbing a drink with your classmates, pair programming...the list goes on. 

Find someone in your cohort who you relate to most, and do a lot of your exercises together. Find someone you don't, and do a lot of your exercises together. If you've gone to the extreme of a coding bootcamp, you're obviously serious about doing what you're doing, so get a lot of different views and opinions of coding and how to build things. 

A lot of people in my cohort I am still good friends with to this day, and part of the reason is they're just great people. The other part is because you are together, working on the same exerises and problems for ultimately the same reason, from around 8 am until midnight some nights. You spend a lot of time together, get to know each other's lives, and get really close. It's like having a second family.
