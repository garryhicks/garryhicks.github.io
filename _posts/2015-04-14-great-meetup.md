Tonight was a great meetup. Met up with another alumni from Lighthouse, and some other cool people. Some familiar faces, some not, but everyone having a great time. Everyone is working their craft, most pretty specific to their niche, but some trying new things. I'm working on a single page Jekyll app, with mixed degrees of success at moments. 

We'll see how it goes. 

Another thing I want to check out is HHVM. It was suggested by my product manager as an addition to my first couple days' project, and I never got around to it after a glitch with the mcrypt extension caused trouble, forced me to switch to a new project while he figured it out. The life of a junior. Definitely want to go back to it though, and learn about it. Maybe I'll do that now. 

Cheers.
